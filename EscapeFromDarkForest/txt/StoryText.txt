You awake to find yourself at the bottom of a deep dark forest.
There are noises coming from all around you. Creaks, rustling, some sort of creatures?
It is very unnerving...
How did you get here? It doesn't matter.
You don't have much food on you, hopefully you can find your way out before you run out, or worse.
